                    Welcome to my first web-page that I have had the great pleasure of creating. I hope
                    you enjoy the design I chose in an attempt to convey a little 
                    bit of professionalism to you, the viewer. Enough about the design and more about me,
                    shall we. I am a typical thirty year old man, ambiguous about my future but always 
                    hopeful and eager to achieve something better than what I have. I am a very energetic
                    young man, I use the term loosly. In my free time I like to play racquetball, weight train,
                    practice Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, run, camp and explore to name a few. But all of that fun
                    stuff was in the past. Coding Bootcamp, taught by the wonderful people at Trilogy and hosted 
                    by UPenn, is the rest of the story now. Creating magnificent pieces of art such as the one 
                    in view right now is where all this artists time goes to. I dont want to come off as sarcastic
                    because it is a labor of love. Not unlike the struggle to earn another stripe on your belt, it
                    takes hard wortk and patience to be great. Live and learn, invest your time and money into 
                    health and education and life will work itself out.
